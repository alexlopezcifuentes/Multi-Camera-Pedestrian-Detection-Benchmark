# Multi-Camera Pedestrian Detection Benchmark Application

This application aims to make an interative framework to evaluate and visualize results for multi-camera pedestrian detection algorithms.

## Usage

To properly setup the enviroment the varibale "GeneralDataPath" should be changed to the desired folder.

An example dataset, detections and ground-truth files can be downloaded executing script "Example.m"

## Application Images
